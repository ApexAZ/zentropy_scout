# Zentropy Scout — Traceability Index

This document maps PRD sections to Requirements to Features to Tasks, enabling Claude Code to build incrementally while maintaining full traceability.

---

## Document Hierarchy

```
PRD Section (Why) → Requirement (What) → Feature (How) → Task (Do)
```

- **PRD:** High-level vision and goals
- **REQ:** Detailed specifications that must be true for the system to work
- **FEAT:** Implementable chunks of functionality
- **TASK:** Atomic work items for Claude Code (tracked in GitHub Issues)
