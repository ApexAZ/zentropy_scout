---

## Critical Rules (Always Apply)

### Code Patterns
1. **Async everywhere** — All DB and LLM calls use `async/await`
2. **Pydantic for validation** — Input/output models for all endpoints
3. **Repository pattern** — `backend/repositories/` for DB access
4. **Service layer** — `backend/services/` for business logic
5. **Type hints required** — No `Any` without justification
6. **One class per file** — Exceptions: small related classes
7. **Files under 300 lines** — Split if larger
8. **No `utils.py` dumping ground** — Be specific (`text_utils.py`, `date_utils.py`)

### File Storage (CRITICAL)
**All files stored as BYTEA in PostgreSQL.** No S3, no filesystem paths.

```python
# CORRECT
class ResumeVersion(Base):
    pdf_content: Mapped[bytes]  # BYTEA column

# WRONG — never do this
pdf_path: str  # No filesystem paths
s3_key: str    # No S3 references
```

### Naming Conventions

| Entity | Convention | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Python files | snake_case | `persona_repository.py` |
| Python classes | PascalCase | `PersonaRepository` |
| DB tables | snake_case, plural | `personas`, `job_postings` |
| API routes | kebab-case | `/api/v1/job-postings` |
| TypeScript files | kebab-case | `use-persona.ts` |
| React components | kebab-case (PascalCase export) | `basic-info-editor.tsx` |

### Error Handling

```python
class ZentropyError(Exception): ...
class NotFoundError(ZentropyError): ...
class ValidationError(ZentropyError): ...

# API returns consistent error shape
{"error": {"code": "PERSONA_NOT_FOUND", "message": "..."}}
```

---

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for all variables with documentation. Key ones:

```bash
# Database (split vars, not a monolithic URL)
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_NAME=zentropy_scout
DATABASE_USER=zentropy_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=zentropy_dev_password

# LLM Providers
LLM_PROVIDER=claude              # claude | openai | gemini
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...            # Also used for embeddings
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...

# Embedding
EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai
EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small

# Auth (local-first mode)
AUTH_ENABLED=false
DEFAULT_USER_ID=                 # Set to your user UUID

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_LLM=10/minute
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
```

## Working with Requirements

1. **Start with `docs/plan/implementation_plan.md`** — shows phases and dependencies
2. **Load only the REQ document(s) needed for current task**
3. **Reference sections like "REQ-005 §4.2"**

| Topic | Primary Document |
|-------|------------------|
| Database schema | REQ-005 |
| API endpoints | REQ-006 |
| LLM providers | REQ-009 |
| Agents | REQ-007 |
| Scoring | REQ-008 |
| Content generation | REQ-010 |
| Frontend application | REQ-012 |

---

## Session Start Checklist

Run these checks at the start of every session (before any implementation work):

1. **Docker/PostgreSQL** — Run `docker compose ps` to verify the database container is running and healthy. If not running, start it with `docker compose up -d` and wait for the healthcheck to pass.
2. **Security scanners** — Check all persistent scanners for new findings. Run these queries in parallel, then report a summary table. If any **new or unexpected** findings exist, **pause and ask the user** whether to address them now or continue to the plan.
   - **GitHub code scanning** (ZAP + Trivy): `gh api repos/ApexAZ/zentropy_scout/code-scanning/alerts?state=open --jq 'length'`
   - **SonarCloud**: WebFetch `https://sonarcloud.io/api/issues/search?componentKeys=ApexAZ_zentropy_scout&resolved=false` — check `total` field
   - **Dependabot**: `gh api repos/ApexAZ/zentropy_scout/dependabot/alerts?state=open --jq 'length'`
   - **Semgrep CI**: `gh run list --workflow=semgrep.yml --limit=1 --json conclusion --jq '.[0].conclusion'`
   - **Dependency audits** (pip-audit + npm audit): `gh run list --workflow=pip-audit.yml --limit=1 --json conclusion --jq '.[0].conclusion'`
   - **Known/expected findings** (do NOT pause for these — only pause if count changes):
     - 6 Trivy CVEs in `gosu` binary (Go stdlib v1.24.6) inside pgvector Docker image — waiting on upstream rebuild. CVEs: CVE-2025-68121, CVE-2025-58183, CVE-2025-61726, CVE-2025-61728, CVE-2025-61729, CVE-2025-61730. If count drops below 6, upstream fix may have landed — notify user to update pinned SHA in `zap-dast.yml`.
     - 1 Semgrep supply chain finding: ajv ReDoS (GHSA-2g4f-4pwh-qvx6) — ESLint pins ajv@6.x, fix only in ajv@8.18.0+. ESLint team declined to upgrade. Dev-only, zero production risk. Also accepted in npm audit (`pip-audit.yml:90`). Waiting on ESLint upstream.
     - 1 npm audit finding: minimatch ReDoS (GHSA-3ppc-4f35-3m26) — ESLint ecosystem pins minimatch<10.2.1. Dev-only, zero production risk. Accepted in npm audit (`pip-audit.yml:90`). Waiting on ESLint upstream.
3. **Implementation plan** — Read `docs/plan/frontend_implementation_plan.md` (or `implementation_plan.md` for backend) to find the current task (first 🟡 or ⬜).
4. **Announce** — Tell the user: "Resuming at Phase X.Y, Task §Z" and confirm Docker + scanner status.

---

## DO / DON'T

### DO:
- **Update `docs/plan/implementation_plan.md` after EVERY subtask** — see `zentropy-planner` skill
- **Commit after EVERY subtask** — do NOT batch commits
- **Ask before pushing** — never auto-push to remote
- Follow TDD (Red-Green-Refactor) — see `zentropy-tdd` skill
- Read relevant REQ document before implementing
- Run tests before claiming task complete
- Keep changes focused — one logical change per commit
- Ask before adding new dependencies
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### DON'T:
- Write implementation code without a failing test first
- Refactor unrelated code while implementing a feature
- Create new architectural patterns without discussing first
- Add "TODO" comments — either fix it or create an issue
- Leave commented-out code
- Change file/folder structure without justification
- Implement features not in requirements

---

## Definition of Done

A task is complete when:
1. ✅ Code implements the requirement (reference REQ section)
2. ✅ **All tests pass (100% pass rate, no skips)** — `pytest -v` / `npm test`
3. ✅ Linter passes (`ruff check .` / `npm run lint`)
4. ✅ Types check (`pyright` / `npm run typecheck`)
5. ✅ Migration tested (upgrade AND downgrade)
6. ✅ Docstrings on public interfaces
7. ✅ No `# TODO` left behind
8. ✅ Committed with conventional commit message
9. ✅ Plan updated (status → ✅)
10. ✅ **STOP: Use AskUserQuestion** — offer "Continue", "Compact first", or "Stop"

---

## Testing Philosophy

### Core Principle: Behavior Over Implementation

**Test WHAT code does, not HOW it does it.** Tests should verify observable behavior from the perspective of the code's users (callers, API consumers), not internal implementation details.

```python
# GOOD: Tests behavior - what the caller cares about
def test_extraction_tasks_use_cheaper_model():
    """Extraction should route to a cost-effective model."""
    adapter = ClaudeAdapter(config)
    model = adapter.get_model_for_task(TaskType.EXTRACTION)
    assert "haiku" in model.lower()  # Behavior: cheaper model selected

# BAD: Tests implementation - brittle, will break on refactor
def test_routing_dict_has_nine_entries():
    """Don't test internal data structure sizes."""
    assert len(DEFAULT_ROUTING) == 9  # Ties test to implementation detail
```

### When Tests Should Change

- ✅ **Change tests when**: Behavior requirements change
- ❌ **Don't change tests when**: Refactoring internals (tests should still pass)

If refactoring breaks tests, the tests were likely testing implementation, not behavior.

### When to Run Tests

| Phase | What to Run | Command | Why |
|-------|-------------|---------|-----|
| **While coding** | Affected tests | `pytest tests/unit/test_file.py -v` | Fast TDD feedback loop |
| **Before commit** | Full test suite | `pytest tests/ -v` | Catch cross-module regressions |
| **Before push** | Full suite + lint + types | `pre-commit run --all-files` | Gate for shared code |
| **CI/CD** | Everything + coverage | GitHub Actions | Final quality gate |

### Test Quality Checklist

Before considering a test complete:

1. **Does it test behavior?** — Would a user/caller care about this assertion?
2. **Is it meaningful?** — Does it catch real bugs, not just "make coverage go up"?
3. **Is it readable?** — Can someone understand the intent without reading implementation?
4. **Is it independent?** — Does it pass/fail regardless of test execution order?
5. **Does it have a clear name?** — `test_<behavior>_when_<condition>` format preferred

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses `pre-commit` to enforce quality before commits. Configuration lives in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

```bash
# Install hooks (one-time setup)
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push

# Run manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

**On commit:** ruff (lint + format), bandit, gitleaks, mypy (backend type check), trailing whitespace, ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript type check.
**On push:** Full pytest suite (backend) + Vitest suite (frontend). See `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for details.

**IMPORTANT:** Never use `--no-verify` to bypass hooks. If tests fail, fix them before committing/pushing. "Pre-existing" failures are still your responsibility to fix.

## Security Tooling Stack

Layered security scanning across local development and CI:

| Layer | Tool | What It Catches | When It Runs |
|-------|------|-----------------|--------------|
| **SAST (deep)** | Semgrep Team | Cross-file taint analysis, FastAPI-native injection detection | CI (GitHub Actions) |
| **SAST (fast)** | Bandit | Python security patterns (injection, secrets, weak crypto) | Pre-commit hook |
| **DAST** | OWASP ZAP | Runtime API vulnerabilities (injection, auth, headers) | CI (push to main) |
| **Code quality** | SonarCloud | Code smells, duplication, security hotspots, complexity | CI (post-push) |
| **Frontend lint** | ESLint + Prettier + TypeScript | React/TS lint, formatting, type safety | Pre-commit hook |
| **Dependencies (Python)** | pip-audit | Known CVEs in Python packages (OSV database) | CI (GitHub Actions) |
| **Dependencies (npm)** | npm audit | Known CVEs in Node.js packages (GitHub Advisory DB) | CI (GitHub Actions) |
| **Dependencies (all)** | Dependabot alerts | Vulnerability alerts for pip, npm, and GitHub Actions deps | GitHub (continuous) |
| **Dependencies (all)** | Dependabot version updates | Automated weekly PRs to bump dependency versions | GitHub (weekly) |
| **Secrets** | gitleaks | Leaked API keys, passwords, tokens in commits | Pre-commit hook |
| **Fuzz testing** | Hypothesis | Property-based testing for sanitization pipeline invariants | pytest (local + CI) |

**Semgrep Team** is free for ≤10 contributors and provides cross-function, cross-file taint tracking with FastAPI-native understanding. Requires `SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN` secret in GitHub repo settings.

**OWASP ZAP** runs API scans against the FastAPI OpenAPI spec in CI. Alert suppressions in `.github/zap-rules.tsv`. Results uploaded to GitHub Security tab (SARIF) and as workflow artifacts (30-day retention).

**Dependabot** provides two services: (1) **vulnerability alerts** — continuous monitoring of the dependency graph for known CVEs, surfaced in the repo's Security tab (private, not visible in Issues); (2) **version updates** — weekly PRs to bump pip, npm, and GitHub Actions dependencies. Configured in `.github/dependabot.yml`.

**pip-audit + npm audit** both run in the "Dependency Audit" CI workflow (`.github/workflows/pip-audit.yml`). pip-audit uses Google's OSV database; npm audit uses the GitHub Advisory Database. Both run on every PR and push to main with retry logic and accepted-advisory filtering.

For detailed security review patterns, see `.claude/agents/security-references.md` `[TOOLS]` section.

---

## Subagents Available

| Agent | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| `req-reader` | Look up requirement specs |
| `code-reviewer` | Review code against conventions |
| `security-reviewer` | Review code for security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10, injection, auth) |
| `qa-reviewer` | Assess whether changes need new Playwright E2E tests |
| `test-runner` | Run and analyze test results |

### Proactive Subagent Usage

**BEFORE starting any implementation task:**
- **`req-reader`**: Always read the relevant REQ section first to get full spec context
- **`Explore`**: If unfamiliar with the code area, explore the codebase first

**AFTER completing code (run in parallel):**
- **`code-reviewer`** + **`security-reviewer`** + **`qa-reviewer`**: Launch ALL THREE simultaneously before commit
- All are read-only — parallel execution is safe and faster

**For open-ended questions:**
- **`Explore`**: Use for "Where is X?", "How does Y work?", "Find all Z" queries instead of manual Glob/Grep

---

## Learned Lessons

Rules discovered through mistakes. Format: `[category] Always/Never [action] because [reason]`

- `[db]` Always check REQ-005 before generating database migrations because schema definitions and field specifications live there.
- `[workflow]` Always commit after each subtask completes because small commits enable easier rollback and progress tracking.
- `[workflow]` Never auto-push to remote; always ask first because user may want to review or batch pushes.
- `[workflow]` Always use `req-reader` subagent before implementing a task because it ensures you have the full spec context.
- `[workflow]` Always use `code-reviewer` subagent after implementing code because it catches convention violations before commit.
- `[workflow]` Always fix ALL code review findings (regardless of severity) before committing because low-severity issues accumulate into technical debt and inconsistent code.
- `[workflow]` Never acknowledge review findings without immediately fixing them because stating intent ("let me address...") without action leads to skipped fixes; use structured findings/resolution tables to enforce follow-through.
- `[workflow]` Always use `Explore` subagent for open-ended codebase questions because it's more thorough than manual Glob/Grep.
- `[workflow]` Never combine multiple subtasks into one because tasks are sized to complete within the ~150k context window, preventing auto-compaction mid-implementation and ensuring progress is captured even if context resets.
- `[git]` Never attempt to commit `.claude/` directory or `CLAUDE_TOOLS.md` because they are gitignored and local-only; these files exist only on the user's machine.
- `[testing]` Never use `--no-verify` to bypass failing tests because even "pre-existing" failures represent technical debt that compounds over time; fix the tests before pushing.
- `[testing]` Always verify Docker/PostgreSQL is running at session start (`docker compose ps`) and before investigating test failures because the container may not be started; skipped tests violate the "100% pass rate, no skips" Definition of Done.
- `[workflow]` After completing a subtask, always follow this exact order: (1) push to remote, (2) use AskUserQuestion tool (not prose) to offer "Continue"/"Compact first"/"Stop", (3) if "Compact first" is selected, immediately provide a detailed summary for compaction. The checklist exists to prevent shortcuts at the finish line when you feel "done."
